E-Library is a multilingual digital education platform that provides affordable and accessible learning materials for students, teachers, and institutions across Ethiopia. It offers curriculum-aligned textbooks, exam prep resources, and research materials both online and offline, in Amharic, Afaan Oromo, Tigrigna, and Somali. The platform empowers learners and educators by making quality education resources available anytime, anywhere. Section 2: Business Model Canvas 1. Customer Segments Who are your most important users or customers? Students (secondary, university, and TVET levels) Teachers, schools, and educational institutions Reflect: They face challenges accessing affordable, up-to-date textbooks and reliable exam prep materials, especially in rural or low-connectivity areas. They also need localized, eco-friendly, and cost-saving digital alternatives. 2. Value Propositions What unique value do you provide? A centralized digital platform offering textbooks, notes, and exam prep materials in multiple local languages. Offline access and low-cost rentals/purchases for equitable education. Reflect: E-Library helps users save money, time, and effort by giving them instant access to quality, curriculumaligned learning content — even without internet access. It also promotes inclusivity and supports teachers in sharing and monetizing content. 3. Channels How do you reach your customers? Mobile and web platforms accessible on smartphones, tablets, and computers. Partnerships with schools, universities, NGOs, and local libraries. Social media platforms (Telegram, WhatsApp, Facebook) and education forums. Reflect: Most students and teachers already use smartphones and online communities for information and learning, making these the most effective channels for engagement. 4. Customer Relationships How do you interact with them? Through an easy-to-use app with tutorials, guides, and customer support. Community features for collaboration, discussion, and content feedback. Institutional partnerships for onboarding and training. Reflect: E-Library blends technology-driven support with community interaction, ensuring users feel guided, connected, and heard. 5. Revenue Streams How do you make money? Book rentals or one-time purchases at affordable prices. Subscriptions for schools and NGOs. Educational partnerships, sponsorship, and advertisements. Future upgrades: premium tools like analytics, certification access, or advanced study kits. Reflect: Customers pay for access, convenience, and personalization — digital learning that’s cheaper, more inclusive, and more sustainable than traditional models. Completing and Pitching the Business Model Section 3: Business Model Canvas (Back Stage – Blocks 6–9) 6. Key Resources What physical, financial, or intellectual assets do you need? Digital platform (web & mobile app infrastructure) Cloud storage and hosting services Content licenses and digital learning materials Skilled team (developers, educators, designers, translators) Funding and partnerships with NGOs or educational bodies Reflect: To operate effectively, E-Library needs a secure and scalable digital infrastructure, a content-rich library, and a dedicated team to maintain and grow the platform sustainably. 7. Key Activities What must your team do well to deliver value? Develop, update, and maintain the digital platform Curate and digitize educational materials in local languages Manage partnerships with schools, NGOs, and government institutions Conduct user research and gather feedback for continuous improvement Market and onboard users through training and awareness campaigns Reflect: Core activities focus on platform development, content management, and community engagement to ensure accessibility, usability, and impact. 8. Key Partnerships Who do you work with externally? Ministry of Education and regional bureaus (curriculum alignment) Schools, universities, and community libraries (implementation) NGOs and donors (funding and outreach support) Ethio Telecom and tech startups (connectivity and technical support) Publishers, authors, and content creators (content supply) Reflect: These partnerships help expand reach, lower costs, and increase trust by ensuring local relevance, accessibility, and collaboration across sectors. 9.
